F.I.D. (It's short for *Fancy Intricate Designs*... not actually, it stands for ***Fundamentals of Interactive Design***, ha)<br>
This GitHub Repository was created by **Jalen Wong**<br>
I'll be posting projects I'm working on to be publicly viewed here as I make progress on them.<br>
**<u>First achievement:</u>** creating this ReadMe in a separate branch, then merging that branch back to the master branch<br>
**<u>Second achievement:</u>** successfully uploaded the **[blackgoose website](https://jking0602.github.io/fid/blackgoose/)**.
- Go ahead.
- Click it.
- It works.

**<u>Third achievement:</u>** downloaded Github Desktop and am now able to edit all my files offline and commit the changes to the Github browser site<br>
Really starting to like using Github, it's much easier than having a folder in my flash drive, but will continue to keep backups in my flash drive.<br>
Follow-up, Atom plus Github equals extreme convenience. I keep my directory open on the left side of Atom for super easy navigation, and being able to switch between open tabs makes proofreading my content much easier and faster.<br>
**<u>Fourth achievement:</u>** learned enough of markdown to make a link to the blackgoose website in this file. Like just a *literal smidgen* of markdown, just to be *fancy* and make the existing text function as a link, so cool<br>
**<u>Fifth achievement:</u>** committed changes to a different person's repository for the first time, so that's one more little thing I didn't know how to do before.
Honestly at this point this is just a bit-by-bit quest log that I'm adding random meaningless value to because I'm ***bored but markdown seems kind of cool***. And as I type all of this in **Atom**, I just found out that I can preview markdown, so I'm going to stop here for today and just change previous stuff.
