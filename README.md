### This GitHub Repository was created by **Jalen Wong**<br>
#### I'll be posting projects I'm working on to be publicly viewed here as I make progress on them.<br>
<small> (first achievement: creating this ReadMe in a separate branch, then merging that branch back to the master branch) </small><br>
<small> (second achievement: successfully uploaded the blackgoose website)</small><br>
<small> (third achievement: downloaded Github Desktop and am now able to edit all my files offline and commit the changes to the Github browser site)</small><br>
##### Really starting to like using Github, it's much easier than having a folder in my flash drive, but will continue to keep backups in my flash drive.<br>
##### Follow-up, Atom plus Github equals extreme convenience. I keep my directory open on the left side of Atom for super easy navigation, and being able to switch between open tabs makes proofreading my content much easier and faster.
